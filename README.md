Material for [MLOps summer course in Nova](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/education/programs/workshops-and-short-duration-courses/summer-course-mlops/#). Also available at [this URL](https://jj.github.io/nova-mlops).

## Learning outcomes of the curricular unit:

A. Understand the fundamental principles of agile development
B. Understand how to integrate design, model development and operations in a
continuous cycle.
C. Apply concepts of quality assurance at every step of the process.
D. Create a complete model as well as a report in a software artifact that
changes continuously.
E. Applying fundamental machine learning and scientific principles to the above
design and reports.

## Syllabus

1. [Agile development](text/01.Agile.md)
2. [Design thinking for solving real-life problems](text/02.Design-Thinking.md).
3. [Test driven development](text/03.TDD.md).
4. Containers for reproducible science.
5. Continuous integration.
6. [MLOps tools](text/06.MLOps-tools.md).
7. Open science: creation and deployment of machine learning projects.

## Sessions

The course is organized as a bootcamp, with different sessions over
which a project, and eventually a coauthored preprint, will be
developed. Students can use [this repository
template](https://github.com/JJ/nova-mlops-template) to kick-start their
projects with spell-checking workflows.

Session objectives and material are like this:

1. [First session](sessions/01.md), meet and greet, organization and setup.
