<h1 id="a-few-guiding-principles">A few guiding principles</h1>
<p>These are a few principles behind this course, and how it is taught. They are written here explicitly for a bit of background on the rest of the material.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No single language can span all necessary techniques needed to become a developer (in data science or anywhere else).</li>
<li>Reproducibility implies following best practices in DevOps, like configuration in the environment</li>
<li>Always add value to the customer by never losing track of the problem that is being solved.</li>
<li>Reproducibility begs free software; if a MLOps workflow is tied to specific companies and tools reproducibility will suffer (or simply be impossible).</li>
<li>When in doubt, be agile.</li>
</ol>
