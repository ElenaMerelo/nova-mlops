# MLOps tools

## TL;DR

Once the methodology is clear, we'll try and see how MLOps tools can be used
profitably to take care of our workflows and make them reproducible.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session the concept of MLOps tools and how to put them to
work will have been assimilated and applied by students. The student
will know how to build, save and publish models to registries so that
they can, later, be used or deployed in any environment.

## Acceptance criteria

The student will have added baseline MLOps tools to their workflows
and deployed at least a model.
