# Agile development

## TL;DR

Machine learning must focus in solving specific problems, and thus should follow
the best practices in software engineering. In this introduction we'll talk
about agile development and how it applies to science, and specifically data
science.

## Agile (Data) science

In software engineering circles, *agile* is a mindset that helps solve problems
putting client first, and focusing on having always minimally viable products.

Science, and data science, needs not be different; we need to put the problem first,
and not any kind of proxies to that problem in the way of reports or papers or
participation in competitions. This is why the manifesto for agile data science
was proposed [@agiledatascience], which not only tries to make data science more
efficient, but also close the gap between academic and industry practitioners.

In order to do that, you need to use the tools that are standard in the industry, such as source control, team work, and continuous integration/delivery tools,
supplemented with specific machine learning tools, such as model registries.

So let's put it to work in the following steps

## Problem goes first

Data science needs to solve a problem. Either getting some insight on a problem,
or provide some easy way to reach decisions, some times both. You need to understand
the nature of the problem before settling down to work on it.
