# Programming infrastructure for MLOps

## TL;DR

MLOps tries to create continuously deployable workflows, and that
requires tests, checks and scripts chained that will be run in a CI/CD
environment. We will learn how to work with these, focusing in the
most popular tool nowadays, GitHub Actions.

## Learning outcomes of this unit

The student will learn different concepts associated with CI/CD
workflows, and will be able to create their own using GitHub actions.

## CI/CD for the masses


In most cases, cloud providers and software as a service companies
will try to offer you a full-span solution, where you will have to pay
every step of the way.

In general, however, creating MLOps workflows can be done easily and
for free if you are working with free software.

MLOps, in general, is strongly related to the movement for public
money, public software, as well as open science. So working in public
repositories is the right thing to do if you are in Academia; it is
probably a very good idea if you are in industry and you are not
working with proprietary data sets.
