# Programming infrastructure for MLOps

In most cases, cloud providers and software as a service companies
will try to offer you a full-span solution, where you will have to pay
every step of the way.

In general, however, creating MLOps workflows can be done easily and
for free if you are working with free software.

MLOps, in general, is strongly related to the movement for public
money, public software, as well as open science. So working in public
repositories is the right thing to do if you are in Academia; it is
probably a very good idea if you are in industry and you are not
working with proprietary data sets.
