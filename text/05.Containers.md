# Reproducible science using containers

## TL;DR

In an open science context, containers are not only good for
registering the infrastructure in MLOps, but also because they can be
easily published and enable anyone to re-use them. We will see best
practices in the creation of *active* and data containers that can be
easily used in ML workflows.
