# Design thinking

## TL;DR

Formulating a solution to a problem is never straightforward. Understanding the
problem and the customer is essential for designing a successful machine
learning workflow or application that meets what the customer wishes.

## What are we talking about

Design thinking is a technique, taken from the design community, that tries to find out the needs of a specific target group in order to create a product that fulfills, at least in part, those needs.

In data science, as in any software development project, one of the hardest part is to find a way to deliver value to a client; even more so, to actually find there's a client for your product and who would that be.

Most data science and engineering tutoriales start with already existing datasets; which is nice because you can easily compare the performance of your method, or your team, against others. However, no, no one is interested in a product that tells you who among the Titanic crew or travelers is going to croak or what kind of iris flower we are dealing with looking at the petals and sepals.

You are probably interested in some things that are closer to yourself, your hobbies or your issues. Or you might be actually interested in creating a product in a startup. In any case, you need to go, find out who that person would be (not if it is yourselv) and find a way to deliver value. Design thinking will help you with that.
