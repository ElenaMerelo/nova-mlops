# A few guiding principles

These are a few principles behind this course, and how it is taught. They are
written here explicitly for a bit of background on the rest of the material.

1. No single language can span all necessary techniques needed to
   become a developer (in data science or anywhere else).
2. Reproducibility implies following best practices in DevOps, like
   configuration in the environment
3. Always add value to the customer by never losing track of the
   problem that is being solved.
4. Reproducibility begs free software; if a MLOps workflow is tied to specific
   companies and tools reproducibility will suffer (or simply be impossible).
5. When in doubt, be agile.
