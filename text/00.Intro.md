# Introduction

MLOps is the combination of the terms and practices of machine learning and DevOps. ML's objective is to create models from data that can be used for prediction, classification or visualization. If you combine that with DevOps, what we have is the reproducible and seamless creation of ML workflows that can be continuously deployed to production.

Scientific computing and development, which includes data *science*, has been generally separated from mainstream best practices in companies; this is in part due to the fact that science works through public funding and not with a customer or new product, and also to the traditional division of science in silos.

DevOps was an attempt to break silos (Development, QA, Ops) in software engineering; MLOps tries to break silos in data engineering, and possibly, in time, in data science.

This course is mainly addressed at students that have been living in *traditional* scientific computing environments, and will try to endow them with an *agile* mindset that will be an useful skill if they want to jump from academia to the industry; if they are already in the industry, it will try to help them get acquainted with data science concepts and techniques that will help them jump-start a career in the coveted *data engineering* wage bracket.

Hope this is useful for anyone arriving here from anywhere, before, during or after the presential summer course.
